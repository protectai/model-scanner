# Notebooks demonstarting Model Serialization Attacks

To learn more about model serialization attacks, please see [Model Serialization Attacks](../docs/model_serialization_attacks.md). 

In the notebooks directory, the notebooks included focus on model serialization attack on a particular ML library. We carry out a stealth mock exfiltration attack. Stealth, because the model still works as before the attack. Mock, because we don't actually carry out an exfiltration attack but show a POC where it can be carried out. 

In addition to demonstrate the model serialization attacks, the safe and unsafe modelscan results are also outlined. The ML libraries covered are:

# PyTorch
Pytorch models can be saved and loaded using pickle. modelscan can scan models saved using pickle. A notebook to illustrate the following is added. 

- Exfiltrate AWS secret on a PyTorch model using `os.system()`
- modelscan usage and expected scan results with safe and unsafe PyTorch models

# Tensorflow
Tensorflow uses saved_model for model serialization. modelscan can scan models saved using saved_model. A notebook to illustrate the following is added. 

- Exfiltrate AWS secret on a Tensorflow model `tf.io.read_file()` and `tf.io.write_file()`
- ModelScan usage and expected scan results with safe and unsafe tensorflow models

# Keras
Keras uses saved_model and h5 for model serialization. A notebook to illustrate the following is added. 

- Exfiltrate AWS secret on a Keras model using `keras.layers.lambda()`
- ModelScan usage and expected scan results with safe and unsafe Keras models

# Classical ML libraries

modelscan also supports all ML libraries that support pickle for their model serialization, such as Sklearn, XGBoost, Catboost etc. A notebook to illustrate the following is added. 

- Exfiltrate AWS secret on a XGBoost model using `os.system()`
- ModelScan usage and expected scan results with safe and unsafe XGBoost models
